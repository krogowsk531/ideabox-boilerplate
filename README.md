**Project Description**

This was a group project that was designed to create idea cards while using mobile queries and input information that can be stored and retrieved from local storage.  You can create a card, save it as favorited or delete it.  The card should also persist when favorited.

**Project Goals**

* Create a functioning website with the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
* Use variables, event listeners, event handlers, classes and functions to allow navigation through the webpage.
* Use media queries in order to have a mobile responsive site.
* Utilize local storage so that our ideas persist across browsers.
* Attempt to have very clean JavaScript and CSS code and refactor whenever possible with a goal of readability.
* Become familiar with the use of GitHub and branching when working on a group project.

**Challenges**

* Mastering the GitHub workflow with many branches and multiple group members.
* Although our code was functional, we knew that we needed to refactor to make the code more readable.
* Creating a smooth transition between desktop and mobile views with input areas while using media queries.
